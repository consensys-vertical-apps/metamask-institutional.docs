# 6. It works when...

... your **Connector** receives recurrent calls on `GET /details` from `https://staking-middleware.dev.metamask-institutional.io` (in dev), and from `https://staking-middleware.metamask-institutional.io` (in prod), and successfully responds to them.

This mean that your **Connector** and **MMI Staking** are properly configured to work together. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰!

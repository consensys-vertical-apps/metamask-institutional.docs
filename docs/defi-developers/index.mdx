# Introduction

As a DeFi protocol developer, you can integrate with MetaMask Institutional and MetaMask to display your protocol's positions, unclaimed rewards, profit & loss, and performance metrics for users in the [MetaMask Institutional Portfolio Dashboard](https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/) and [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mmi-pd" label="MetaMask Institutional" default>
    ![DeFi Adapters MMI PD Example](/img/defi-adapters/mmi-pd-example.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mm-p" label="MetaMask Portfolio">
    ![DeFi Adapters MM P Example](/img/defi-adapters/mm-p-example.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To facilitate this, weâ€™ve developed the [DeFi Adapter Library](https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters), an open-source TypeScript library designed for seamless interaction with DeFi protocols.

## Challenges in DeFi

The [DeFi Adapter Library](https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters) solves five problems that exist within the ecosystem today:

- Data providers constantly race with users to stay updated with the latest protocols
- There's no correct insight or implementation (time-weighted returns) on the profit and performance of DeFi positions over time for users
- There's no ecosystem-wide open-source standard for read and write data
- There's no scaled approach that benefits the broad ecosystem
- There's no seamless, simple and delightful developer experience to implement support for DeFi protocol data

## Developer Experience

With our user-centric product principles, we have built a repository with several features to empower developers to build and consume DeFi adapters. Our explicit goal is to allow any protocol engineer to spend a maximum of four engineering hours to create a new DeFi adapter.

We have a seamless command line interface (CLI) that guides developers through the primitive they are building and offers existing templates that provide most of the required code. Once an adapter is built, we offer a UI for developers to review and quality assure their output. We also offer a video tutorial and an FAQ section to guide through the process and make the developer experience as simple and seamless as possible.

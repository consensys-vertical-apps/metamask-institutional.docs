# 3. Inspect your new adapter

After completing all the prompts, the CLI will generate the code files for your new adapter in `/packages/adapters-library/src/adapters/<protocol-id>/products/<product-id>/xxxxAdapter.ts`.

The video below walks you through the contents of the generated files and explains any modifications you'll need to make.

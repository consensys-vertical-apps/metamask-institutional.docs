# 6. Fill code gaps

Check if the following methods need to be implemented or code has already been added based on the CLI questions:

- `getProtocolTokens`
- `getPositions`
- `unwrap`
- `getWithdrawals`
- `getDeposits`
- `getTotalValueLocked`

Finally, if any reward method has been added, the implementation will have to be provided for it to work:

- `getRewardPositions`
- `getRewardWithdrawals`
- `getExtraRewardPositions`
- `getExtraRewardWithdrawals`
